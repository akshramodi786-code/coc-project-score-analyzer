TITLE :- C Project: Student Score Analyzer
DESCRIPTION: A C program that asks the user how many students they want to enter (e.g., 5 or 10), then reads those scores into an array. Once the scores are stored, the program must analyze this data and print a summary report.
CONCEPT USED: 
For C : 
1) Arrays – To store multiple scores (float scores[n];)
2) Conditional statements (if) – To check and update highest or lowest numbers (if(score > max_score_so_far))
3) Input/Output (scanf, printf) – Reading scores from the user and displaying results
4) For loops – Iterating over each student/number (for(int i=0;i<n;i++))
5) Variables- eg:int n, float score[n];
For Maths :
Mean=sum of numbers/n
Maximum / Minimum – Finding the largest or smallest number in a set
HOW TO COMPILE :
Write " gcc student_score_analyzer.cpp" then Write "a.exe" . The code should compile.
HOW TO RUN :
If we want the desire output of
Class average=82.4,highest score=95 and lowest score=61, then you can enter the data of 5 student and the scores value to be 61,85,85,86,95 resp.
